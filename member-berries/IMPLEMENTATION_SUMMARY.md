# Member Berries Apple MCP - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Security Audit ✅
- Analyzed the original apple-mcp codebase
- Identified all tools and their capabilities
- No malicious code found - uses legitimate JXA (JavaScript for Automation)

### 2. Code Stripping ✅
Successfully removed the following features for security:
- ❌ **Messages** - No access to iMessage/SMS
- ❌ **Mail** - No email reading or sending
- ❌ **Contacts** - No address book access
- ❌ **Web Search** - No internet browsing via DuckDuckGo
- ❌ **Maps** - No location services or mapping

### 3. Features Retained ✅
Only kept the productivity tools:
- ✅ **Calendar** - Full read/write access to calendar events
- ✅ **Notes** - Full access to Apple Notes
- ✅ **Reminders** - Full access to Apple Reminders

### 4. Rebranding ✅
- Changed all references from "Claude" to "Member Berries"
- Updated package name to "member-berries-apple-mcp"
- Added 🫐 emoji branding throughout
- Created new README with security-focused messaging

### 5. File Structure
```
member-berries/
├── index.ts          # Main server (stripped down)
├── tools.ts          # Only 3 tools defined
├── utils/
│   ├── calendar.ts   # Unchanged from original
│   ├── notes.ts      # Changed default folder to "Member Berries"
│   └── reminders.ts  # Unchanged from original
├── package.json      # Updated branding and metadata
├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
├── README.md         # Comprehensive documentation
├── LICENSE           # MIT License
├── install.sh        # Installation helper
└── test.sh          # Basic functionality test
```

### 6. Security Improvements
- Removed all network-capable features
- No access to personal communications
- Minimal attack surface (only 3 apps)
- Clear documentation about what's included/excluded
- Maintained all error handling from original

### 7. Next Steps

To use Member Berries:

1. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rogers/GitHub/member-berries-apple-mcp/member-berries
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh test.sh
   ```

3. Run installation:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. Add to Claude Desktop config as shown in the installation output

5. Test the integration in Claude with commands like:
   - "Show me my calendar for today"
   - "Create a note called 'Test Note'"
   - "List all my reminders"

### 8. Important Notes

- The server requires macOS (Apple apps are Mac-only)
- First use will prompt for permissions in System Settings
- All operations are local - no data leaves your Mac
- The original apple-mcp code is clean and well-written
- Member Berries maintains the same code quality

## Security Validation

The Member Berries fork successfully:
- ✅ Removes all communication tools (Messages, Mail)
- ✅ Removes all external data access (Contacts, Web)
- ✅ Removes location services (Maps)
- ✅ Maintains only local productivity tools
- ✅ Cannot access the internet
- ✅ Cannot send any messages or emails
- ✅ Cannot access your contacts

This makes it safe to use with Claude while maintaining useful productivity features.

🫐 Member Berries - Remember when MCP servers were simple and secure!
