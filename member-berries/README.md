- üìÖ **"How did your dentist appointment go yesterday?"**
- üõí **"Did you manage to get those eggs from the store?"**
- üìù **"I see you created that project outline - need help expanding it?"**
- ‚úì **"Don't forget about that presentation tomorrow at 2pm!"**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime: `brew install bun`
- Claude Desktop app

### Setup

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/member-berries-apple-mcp.git
cd member-berries-apple-mcp/member-berries
bun install
```

2. Add to Claude Desktop configuration (Settings > Developer > Model Context Protocol):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "member-berries": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/member-berries-apple-mcp/member-berries/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Add the custom prompt to Claude (see CLAUDE_PROMPT_SETUP.md)

4. Restart Claude Desktop

## Usage

Member Berries works best when you let it check your events at the start of each conversation:

```
You: Hi Claude!

Claude: Hey there! Let me check what you've been up to... 
*[Member Berries checks recent events]*
How did the grocery shopping go yesterday? Did you find everything you needed?

You: Yes! Actually got everything on my list for once.

Claude: That's great! I noticed you have that team presentation coming up tomorrow at 2pm. Would you like help preparing for it?
```

## Custom Prompt Setup

For the full experience, add the Member Berries prompt to your Claude preferences. This helps Claude use the memory features naturally. See `CLAUDE_PROMPT_SETUP.md` for the complete prompt.

## How It Works

1. **Event Tracking** - Member Berries monitors your calendar for completed events
2. **Memory Creation** - Creates contextual memories with categories (shopping, meeting, health, etc.)
3. **Conversation Starters** - Generates appropriate icebreakers based on event context
4. **Natural Integration** - Claude uses these memories to make conversations flow naturally

## Examples

### Shopping Context
- Event: "Buy groceries - Whole Foods"
- Memory: "User went grocery shopping at Whole Foods"
- Starter: "How was Whole Foods? Hope it wasn't too crowded!"

### Meeting Context
- Event: "Team Standup - Zoom"
- Memory: "User had team standup meeting"
- Starter: "How did the team standup go? Any interesting updates?"

### Health Context
- Event: "Dentist Appointment"
- Memory: "User had dentist appointment"
- Starter: "Hope the dentist appointment went smoothly! Everything okay?"
