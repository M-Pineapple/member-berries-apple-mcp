# ü´ê Member Berries - A Focused Fork for Privacy-Conscious Users

## Our Philosophy

Member Berries is **NOT** about criticizing the original apple-mcp (which is excellently coded and incredibly useful!). It's about recognizing that different users have different needs and comfort levels.

## The Real Story

### **The Original apple-mcp is FANTASTIC** 
- Brilliantly implemented
- Covers every Apple app you might need
- Perfect for power users who want full AI assistance
- Well-maintained and actively developed

### **Why Member Berries Exists**
Some users told us:
> "I love the idea of AI helping with my calendar, but I'm not comfortable giving it access to my messages and emails"

> "My company would allow Calendar/Notes/Reminders access, but not Messages/Mail/Contacts"

> "I want to stay within Apple's walled garden for privacy, but limit what the AI can see"

## Our Approach: Thoughtful Reduction

### **What We Did**
1. **Forked with Respect** - The original code is excellent
2. **Focused on Memory & Productivity** - Just the tools needed for daily organization
3. **Preserved Apple's Privacy** - Everything stays within Apple's ecosystem
4. **Acknowledged the Trade-off** - Yes, you're sharing Calendar/Notes/Reminders with Claude

### **What We DIDN'T Do**
- Claim the original is insecure ‚ùå
- Add complex security features ‚ùå
- Pretend we invented something new ‚ùå
- Say our way is "better" ‚ùå

## The Honest Trade-off

```
Using Member Berries means:
‚úÖ Claude can see your calendar events
‚úÖ Claude can read/write your notes
‚úÖ Claude can manage your reminders
‚ùå Claude cannot see your messages
‚ùå Claude cannot read your emails
‚ùå Claude cannot access your contacts
‚ùå Claude cannot browse the web
```

**You're trading SOME privacy for productivity, not ALL privacy.**

## Who Is This For?

### **Member Berries Users**
- Want AI productivity help
- Have privacy boundaries
- Work in regulated environments
- Prefer minimal permissions
- Value focused tools

### **Original apple-mcp Users**
- Want comprehensive AI assistance
- Comfortable with full access
- Need message/email integration
- Power users
- Value complete functionality

**Both are valid choices!**

## Our Unique Value Proposition

> "Member Berries is the 'Diet Coke' of Apple MCPs - Same great taste, fewer permissions"

We're not "more secure" - we're "more focused." We give you:

1. **Clear Boundaries** - You know exactly what Claude can and cannot access
2. **Corporate-Friendly** - Easier to get IT approval for limited tools
3. **Peace of Mind** - Your communications remain completely private
4. **Apple's Privacy** - Everything stays in Apple's ecosystem
5. **Anthropic's AI** - Get Claude's help without giving it everything

## The Technical Nuance

- **Original**: Uses all Apple APIs for maximum capability
- **Member Berries**: Uses subset of Apple APIs for focused capability
- **Both**: Keep data within Apple's security model
- **Both**: Require trusting Claude with what you share

## In Summary

Member Berries isn't "better" - it's "different." 

We took an excellent, comprehensive tool and created a focused version for users who want to:
- ü´ê 'Member when apps only asked for what they needed?
- ü´ê 'Member when you could choose what to share?
- ü´ê 'Member when less was sometimes more?

**We 'member, and we respect both choices!**
