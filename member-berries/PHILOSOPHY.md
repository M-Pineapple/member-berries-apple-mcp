# ü´ê Member Berries - A Focused Fork for Privacy-Conscious Users

## Our Philosophy

Member Berries is **NOT** about criticizing the original apple-mcp (which is excellently coded and incredibly useful!). It's about recognizing that different users have different needs and comfort levels.


## Our Approach: Thoughtful Reduction

### **What We Did**
1. **Forked with Respect** - The original code is excellent
2. **Focused on Memory & Productivity** - Just the tools needed for daily organization
3. **Preserved Apple's Privacy** - Everything stays within Apple's ecosystem


**You're trading SOME privacy for productivity, not ALL privacy.**

## Who Is This For?

### **Member Berries Users**
- Want AI productivity help
- Have privacy boundaries
- Work in regulated environments
- Prefer minimal permissions
- Value focused tools

## The Technical Nuance

- **Original**: Uses all Apple APIs for maximum capability
- **Member Berries**: Uses subset of Apple APIs for focused capability
- **Both**: Keep data within Apple's security model
- **Both**: Require trusting Claude with what you share

## In Summary

Member Berries isn't "better" - it's "different." 

We took an excellent, comprehensive tool and created a focused version for users who want to:
- ü´ê 'Member when apps only asked for what they needed?
- ü´ê 'Member when you could choose what to share?
- ü´ê 'Member when less was sometimes more?

**We 'member, and we respect both choices!**
