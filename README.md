# 🫐 Member Berries Apple MCP

Give Claude memory of your Apple Calendar, Notes & Reminders - with personality!

## What is Member Berries?

A fun fork of [apple-mcp](https://github.com/dhravya/apple-mcp) that makes Claude feel like a helpful friend who actually remembers your day:

- **"How did your dentist appointment go?"** - Remembers completed events
- **"Don't forget about that presentation at 2pm!"** - Proactive reminders
- **"I see you created that project outline"** - Tracks your notes

Built on the excellent apple-mcp by [@dhravya](https://github.com/dhravya), stripped down to essentials, and enhanced with a memory layer that makes conversations feel natural.
